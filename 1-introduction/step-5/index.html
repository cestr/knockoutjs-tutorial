        <h2>Good job!</h2>
        <p>This was a very basic example, but it did illustrate some of the key points of MVVM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You've got a clean, object-oriented representation of your UI's data and behaviors (your viewmodel)</li>
            <li>Separately, you've got a declarative representation of how it should be displayed visibly (your view)</li>
            <li>You can implement arbitrarily sophisticated behaviors just by updating the viewmodel object. You don't have to
                worry about which DOM elements need to be changed/added/removed - the framework can take care of synchronizing
                things for you.</li>
        </ul>
